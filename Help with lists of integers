# Practicing With Lists


# Declares the list
x = [2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4]

# Prints the list normally
print(x)

# Prints the highest value in the list
most = max(x)
print(most)

# Prints the lowest value in the list
minimal = min(x)
print(minimal)

# Prints the most repeated value within the list
most = max(x, key=x.count)
print(most)

# Prints the list in reverse
x.reverse()
print(x)

# Prints the sum of the integers in the list
print(sum(x))

# Prints the product of the integers in the list
import math
print(math.prod(x))

# Prints the average value from the list of integers
from statistics import mean
print(mean(x))

# Prints the number of elements in a list (length)
print(len(x))

# Prints the list in a sorted, ascending order
x.sort()
print(x)

# Prints the list in a sorted, descending order
x.sort(reverse=True)
print(x)
